<p>Episode 2: Zoro Backstory, Morgan and Helmeppo intro.
  Coby and Luffy reach Marine base island thanks to coby's skills as a sailor, everyone in the town is afraid of Zoro which is reasonable
  but also afraid of the Marine Captain Morgan. Morgan's son(Helmeppo) bullies the little kid who tries to feed zoro rice balls(onigiri)
  made of sugar instead of the traditional salt. Zoro says his determinism is great and eats the onigiri which fell on the ground. Luffy 
  and coby come to know the reason Zoro was tied from the little girl which makes luffy hit Helmeppo and think Zoro should be his nakama
  (crew mate), goes to retrieve his katana(sword) and accidentally breaks Morgan's statue. Morgan is shown to be evil and dictatorial leader,
  Coby frees Zoro's restraints. Luffy recovers the stolen katana of zoro's from Helmeppo's room and returns in time to protect zoro and coby
  from gunfire of marines as he is invulnerable to bullets being made of rubber. Re-iteration of the point by luffy that he is the one who 
  will become the pirate king.</p>
  
  
<p>Episode 3: Zoro Backstory, 
  Luffy retrieves 3 swords and asks zoro to take his back when zoro reveals all of them are his, Luffy says- Do you wanna fight with me and
  become my nakama or die in the hands of marines, zoro fights alongside luffy. Zoro says he will follow his ambitions of becoming the 
  greatest swordsman though he is a pirate and says he will kill luffy if asked to give up on his ambition. Marines rejoice after Morgan is
  defeated as they were all afraid of him. Nami tries to find the map to grandline but retrieves document related to heartless Buggy. Zoro
  is shocked to see that luffy ate more than him as zoro didn't have any(much) food for 3 weeks.
  Zoro is shocked to discover the crew consists of Zoro and Luffy alone, also to know that there is only a boat as of now. Luffy infuriates
  coby so that he would hit him and the marines would not believe that coby is a friend of luffy granting him passage to become a marine.
  Luffy says the reason he wants to become pirate king is the promise made to that man who entrusted him the straw hat that he currently
  wears.
